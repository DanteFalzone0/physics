Run `make` to compile the program normally; this produces a file
called `physics.x86` which is executable. Some other make rules:

    run - run the program.
    debug - compile with debugging symbols for gdb.
    asm - compile into Assembly for you to read if you want to.
    clean - remove the executable and object files from /src/.
    prof - make a program that will output gmon.out for gprof.
    clean-prof - remove both the executable and gmon.out.
    clean-asm - remove Assembly files, if present, from /src/.
